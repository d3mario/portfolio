       <h1>LEWD Society Bio</h1>
        <p>Top 40 and Urban Music’s newest group LEWD Society is proving to everyone that they intend to be the future of popular music. Using basic skill and knowledge of song writing through years of musical admiration, C Mar and G Witt recorded their first song "tell it to my heart" in an apartment G rented back in late 2007. To the group’s surprise, the single was played for nearly 1 million listeners on a live club broadcast with clear channels CHANNEL955 (WKQI-Detroit) in Detroit, MI. Unfortunately a change in family circumstances brought the group’s hasty success to a halt shortly thereafter….UNTIL NOW! </p>
               <p>In the summer of 2008, “C Mar” made the trip from his hometown of Rochester, NY to the Metro Detroit area to pursue a childhood dream with his cousin, known to everyone else as “G Witt”.  In less than two years recording music consistently, they have independently managed to place their top 100 single "Major" in rotation on the #1 top 40 station in Detroit.  LEWD Society has also been heard on local station FM98 (WJLB-Detroit) and national stations RadioNOW 100.9 (WNOU-Indianapolis), Magic 98.9 (WSBY-Salisbury, MD), Power 106 (KPWR-Los Angeles), B96 (KTTB-Minneapolis), Jamz 96.3 (WAJZ-Albany, NY), 93.7WBLK (WBLK-Buffalo), E93 (WEAS-Savannah, GA), JAM'N 94.5 (WJMN-Boston). Its safe to say "they're coming."</p>
        
       <p> LEWD Society's music catalog delivers a distinctive, uncommon sound, yet still manages to keep the ear of any unbiased listener tuned in. Unique melodies along with catchy lyrics helps create their diverse sound and set this duo apart from anything else heard in music today. The seamless blend of Rap, Pop and R&B can be attributed to the trust and confidence they have in each other as artists, family and business partners...a relationship seldom seen in the music industry. The end result boast a motto the world can live by....Love Everything We Do (LEWD).
        
        You can find LEWD Society’s early E.P, singles “Miss Propane", “Headboard Jumpin” and Top 100 single "MAJOR" on all online music stores such as iTunes, Rhapsody and Amazon Mp3 NOW! </p>
