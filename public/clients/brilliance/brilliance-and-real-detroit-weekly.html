          <p class="article-text">The Detroit Music Awards turn 20 years old this year. April 15 will see The Fillmore packed with a who's-who of Detroit music royalty. But there's also a whole bunch of folks you might not know, whether they're up-and-comers or local mainstays that you just haven't familiarized yourself with yet. Well, we've done the heavy-lifting for you, and put together a quick list of five artists who you should take the time to get to know. </p>
          <p class="article-text">The story of the man who calls himself Brilliance is a story of hard work, self-promotion and understanding the roots of what it is you're doing. To be stereotypical for a quick moment, most musicians are influenced by the artists that came before them in their respective genre. They draw their inspiration from a style that they would like to emulate, or perhaps their ear is drawn to a particular type of similarly categorized music. Brilliance, the MC and hip-hop artist from the Detroit suburbs, has gained influence from a pool that includes more of a rock and soul vibe, which is highly evident upon listening to the man work. His father's love of blues and classic rock led to his current inclusion of a more diverse offering in his brand of hip-hop. He counts among his influences not just Nas, Tupac and Eminem, but Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Sublime. His penchant for creative endeavors outside of music has also assisted him in his promotional efforts. Aside from being a musician, he is also a graphic designer, writer, and producer. Starting at the young age of 19, he's been networking, pushing his music into club rotation, buddying up to the most relevant radio stations, working with highly respected producers (Jared Lee Gosselin, Asar, Jeff Bass) and perfecting his live show. His performance, which features multiple live instruments (which is rare for hip-hop) is what he feels has helped his "transformation back into a live feel, back to my roots," and that is ultimately what sets him aside. That showmanship in particular will be under the microscope at the 2011 DMAs, as he will be performing, and it has been promised that it will be one to remember. Brilliance is nominated for "Outstanding Hip-Hop Artist/Group," "Outstanding Hip-Hop/MC" and "Outstanding Urban/Funk/Hip-Hop Recording."</p>
